## Object-level SLAM for Indoor Environments
[Sep 2019 - Current] The Robotics Institute of Beihang University  
* Proposed an object-level semantic SLAM algorithm based on RGB-D data, which uses a quadric surface as an object model to compactly represent the object's position, orientation, and shape.
* Introduced the support relationships between objects and the structure planes to estimate 3D objects parameters.
* Introduced a nonparametric pose graph to solve data associations in the back end, and innovatively applied it to the quadric surface model.
* Evaluated the algorithm on two public datasets and an author-collected mobile robot dataset and obtained obvious improvements on the localization accuracy and mapping effects compared with two state-of-art object SLAM algorithms.

## Coarse-to-fine Visual Localization using Semantic Compact Map
[Oct  2018 â€“ Jul 2019] Research Intern of the SLAM Group in Megvii (Face++) Technology Co., Ltd.
* Proposed a coarse-to-fine localization system with pole-like objects extracted from semantically segmented images.
* Proposed a localization method decoupling translation from rotation using a monocular camera as a protractor to estimate the vehicle poses accurately. 
* Achieved comparable accuracy with SIFT feature-based methods with a significant small map size about 2.7 kb/km.

## Navigation with Floor Map for Domestic Robots
[Sep 2017 - Feb 2018] Intelligent Robot Laboratory of Tsukuba University 
* Designed a navigation and mapping system for domestic logistic robots to travel from the entry of a floor to the destination room described by room number, such as A311, which enters an unknown building at the first time. 
* Proposed aligning the floor map for human, which commonly exists at the entry of building floors, with a grid map maintained by laser sensor and wheeled odometry of robots, then planning a path using the semantic information on the floor map, e.g. room numbers and positions, feasible corridors.
* Used a monocular camera with OCR recognition algorithm to check the destination room accurately.
